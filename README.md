# SDLPong

Basic Pong-like game made using SDL

## Building and Running

### Linux

To build the game, run `make build` in the root directory, or `make run` to build & run.

### Windows

Sadly there is no way to build/run this game on Windows as is. I may include some precompiled executables in future releases.
